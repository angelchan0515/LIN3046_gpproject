# Introduction
Due to COVID-19,  all of Hong Kong’s school suspension classes. No one tells stories to Kindergarden’s students that will affect students' language development and pronunciation system. So, we would like to create a story audiobook to help kids develop basic language skills and profoundly expand their vocabularies.On top of this, help students develop their critical thinking skills through questions.

# Descriptive Data
We collect our data at Youtube. Also, we used Beecut and Whisper to help transform audio to transcips. Finally, we used excel to store our data.

# Research Questions or Problem Addressed
Through the project, we would like to find out the methods of storytelling. What are the differences in tone and delivery between different storytellers.
