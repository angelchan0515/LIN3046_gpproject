# Introduction
Because of COVID-19, all schools in Hong Kong had to shut down, and that means no more storytelling for the little ones in Kindergarten. It's a bummer because hearing stories helps kids with their language skills and pronunciation. So, we've decided to step up and create a super cool story audiobook that will help these kiddos develop their language skills and learn tons of new words. But we're not stopping there! We're also including fun questions throughout the audiobook to get them thinking critically. We want these kids to have a blast while expanding their minds and becoming language superstars, even if they can't go to school right now.

## Descriptive Data
We collect our data at Youtube. Also, we used Beecut and Whisper to help transform audio to transcips. Finally, we used excel to store our data.

## Research Questions or Problem Addressed
Through the project, we would like to find out the methods of storytelling. What are the differences in tone and delivery between different storytellers.

## The data collection process
First, we begin our data collection process by exploring the vast collection of stories available on YouTube, where we encounter a wide array of genres.Taking into account the variety seen in these genres, we use a methodical approach, choosing six exemplary stories from each group. We plan to conduct a comparison study in an effort to identify the unique characteristics that make these tales unique. We hope to learn more about the distinctive qualities, recurring themes, and storytelling strategies that characterise each genre by closely analysing and analysing these stories. We intend to clarify the elements that most powerfully connect with viewers and illuminate the subtleties that add to these stories' engaging quality through this careful investigation. In the end, our research aims to disentangle the complex web of narrative on YouTube, providing insightful knowledge on the craft of story construction and its influence on viewer involvement.

# Segmentation
We collected the audio data from YouTuber. After that we transcribe it into written format for simplified analysis. We used various tools like Beecut and Whisper, which use advanced speech recognition algorithms to accurately transcribe the audio. These tools gave us a written version of the audio material, making it easier for additional examination. 

After receiving the transcriptions, we sorted the information using Excel as our main storage system. Excel's ability to adapt to different tasks and its widespread use enabled us to effectively handle and alter the data. In order to have a structured method, we divided the data according to different factors such as the assertions of the story narrator, various storytellers, and dialogues of characters. A separate sheet in Excel was designated for each segment, allowing for organized access and efficient analysis. 

By utilizing this segmentation approach, we benefited from having separate data units that could be assessed and studied individually. It allowed us to concentrate on certain parts of the information and detect trends or connections in each section. In addition, this structured method simplifies the resolution of particular issues that crop up during the analysis process. By looking at the specific section in Excel, we could promptly find and offer specific solutions for the problems that were identified. 

To sum up, our approach included transforming audio information into text using applications such as Beecut and Whisper, then arranging the written records in Excel by segmenting the data. This method made sure that access was easy, manageable, and gave a solid basis for analysis, allowing us to gain valuable insights and effectively tackle any obstacles faced during the process.

# Annotation
In the Annotation, we will analyze six Annotations which are Character Conversion, Vocals (Undulate), Question, Discourse fillers, Modifier, Code-switching. 
Firstly, the annotations of Character Conversion. “/c/” have been used to show the questions that the narrator asked during the story time. As a visually impaired person, they can not see how many characters there are in a book. audiobooks can help them identify how many characters there are because the storyteller will be playing the voices of multiple characters at the same time, allowing them to know how many characters there are.

Secondly, the annotations of voice (Undulation). We will analyze whether the voice line has ups and downs because the ups and downs of the voice will affect the listener’s feeling and understanding. Moreover, the ups and downs of the voice can guide the listener to be more involved in the world of the story and enhance the listener’s interest in the story. Also, the rise and fall of the voice can help the listener to understand the emotion conveyed in the story. 

Thirdly, the annotation of Question. “/q/” have been used to show the questions that the narrator asked during the story time. The purpose of a question sentence is to get the listener thinking, to stimulate curiosity and to encourage active participation in the text. In addition, questions can help them focus more on the audiobook, promote deeper understanding and explore their critical thinking. 

Fourthly, the annotation of discourse fillers. Data validation has been used which is the process of checking and validating collected data before it is used. In any type of data processing, whether collecting data, analyzing it or structuring it for presentation, data validation must be performed to ensure accurate results. There are many fillers in the Cantonese world. Therefore, using data validation will be more convenient. It also helps to increase the tone of voice so that visually impaired children can feel the atmosphere of the storybook. Even if they can't see the pictures in the story, they can use the narrator's voice to fantasize about what's going on in the story. 

Then, the annotation of Modifier.  It makes sentences lively and interesting, and to improve children's sense of language. Also, Teach children the concept of adding adjectives before nouns. Engage children in the story. 

Lastly, the annotation of Code-switching. Children with visual impairment may have low self-esteem due to their disability, leading to social isolation. It is difficult for them to learn to communicate through social interaction, whereas the culture of Hong Kong is to communicate in biliteracy and trilingualism. So, the audio-books enable visually impaired children to learn about the culture of Hong Kong and to learn to communicate.


# Methodology

## A) Collection
Gather a wide variety of story audiobooks from YouTube to ensure diversity in storytelling styles and content.

Utilize tools such as Beecut and Whisper for the conversion of audio content into written transcripts, allowing for easier analysis and evaluation.

Employ Excel or any other appropriate software to effectively store and organize the collected data, facilitating seamless access and further analysis of the information.

## B) Cleaning
Eliminate any content from the collected YouTube audiobooks that is not directly related to the story, ensuring that only the story content remains for analysis.

Utilize Beecut and Whisper tools to convert the audio content of the audiobooks into written transcripts. Thoroughly review the transcripts for accuracy and make any required corrections.

Exclude any unnecessary information or non-verbal elements from the transcripts, such as questionnaires or non-verbal sounds, to focus solely on the story text.

## C) Analysis
Storytelling Techniques: Examine the gathered audiobooks and identify the diverse range of storytelling techniques employed in each. These techniques may encompass elements such as voice modulation, character voices, gestures, props, or interactive components. Categorize and describe these techniques to gain insights into their effects on engagement and language development.

Language Usage and Complexity: Compare the transcripts of various stories and analyze the language usage, richness of vocabulary, sentence structure, and complexity. Identify any prevailing patterns or disparities in language utilization that might influence language acquisition and expansion among Kindergarten students.

Tone and Delivery: Construct a framework for assessing and evaluating the tone and delivery of different storytellers. This framework should encompass factors such as intonation, pace, emphasis, and overall engagement. Analyze how these factors influence the students' enjoyment, comprehension, and critical thinking skills during the storytelling experience.

# Discussion
We have discovered that all of the stories are free of sentence structure mistakes. Additionally, most storytellers employ varying tones and inflections in their voices, which is effective in capturing the attention of students. Despite storytelling relying on spoken language, there is a deliberate avoidance of excessive modal particles in each sentence. This is because modal particles, as modifier words, tend to confuse students.

# Relevant licensing issues and ethical concerns 
 1. Youtube video (Copyright)
 2. Over reliance on AI (Transforming audio data to transcripts)


# Potential use cases and future development.
We hope that our audiobook can provide Chinese PinYin or different language transcripts. For example, English and Putonghua transcripts. This will help students develop a comprehensive language system and supports students in building a solid foundation in biliteracy and trilingualism.
